## Large Files API
Service for serving large files from [humanitarian.io](http://humanitarian.io).

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/humanitarianio/hio-serve.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/humanitarianio/hio-serve)

## GAUL Boundary Set
The service only contains the GAUL boundary set. It follows `REST` principles. Here's an example of how it works:

* `humanitarian.io/gaul/2014/2` Will download the administrative level 2 global boundary set for the 2014 release of the GAUL bondary set.

**PS:** *You will need to download those separately*.


## Docker Setup

This container has no links. It's active port is port `9000`.
